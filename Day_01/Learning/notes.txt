1. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
- Learn what HTTP actually does in backend communication.
-HTTP = rules for how clients (like browsers) and servers (like FastAPI) communicate.
-You send requests â†’ server sends responses.

### Common HTTP Methods:

| Method | Meaning     | Example               |
| ------ | ----------- | --------------------- |
| GET    | Read data   | Fetch a list of users |
| POST   | Create data | Add a new user        |
| PUT    | Update data | Update user info      |
| DELETE | Delete data | Remove a user         |


2. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- These are the basic operations your backend performs with data.
- You can practice them using FastAPI routes:

    @app.post("/user")      # Create
    @app.get("/user/{id}")  # Read
    @app.put("/user/{id}")  # Update
    @app.delete("/user/{id}") # Delete


3. What is API?
Application Programming Interface are mechanism that enables two software components such as forntend
and backend of an application to communicate with each other using a defined set of rules, protocol
and data formate.


4. What is FastAPI?
It is a mordern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python
